I am tenure-track-professor for Multifactorial Data Analysis and Machine Learning in the Life Sciences at the Centre for Organismal Studies (COS) and the Centre for Scientific Computing (IWR) of Heidelberg University.

Trained as a mathematician, I obtained a PhD in Statistics from ETH Zurich and European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL)  working with Peter BÃ¼hlmann and Wolfgang Huber. Afterwards I worked a postdoc at the German Cancer Research Center and the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Cambridge. As a visiting researcher I worked with Susan Holmes at Stanford University and with Dagmar Iber at D-BSSE.

In my research, I aim to enable insights into fundamental biological processes by leaveraging statistical reasoning in combination with modern machine learning and advance the methodology to address challenges in their application to the life sciences.
